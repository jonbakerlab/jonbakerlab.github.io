We study how the oral microbiome impacts human health.

## The oral microbiome

The oral microbiome is the collection of microorganisms that live in the human oral cavity, and includes bacteria, viruses, archaea, and microeukaryotes such as fungi.  These microbes have a major impact on human health, with extremely prevalent and costly oral diseases such as dental caries, periodontal disease, and oral cancers being caused mainly by the bacteria and viruses present in the mouth.

We leverage emerging technologies in sequencing, mass spectrometry, bioinformatics and molecular biology to answer fundamental questions regarding the ecology, physiology, and pathogenesis of the oral microbiome.  This has included pioneering the use of nanopore sequencing on saliva and oral bacterial RNA. The resulting work discovered new bacterial species and biosynthetic pathways which impact the ecology of the oral microbiome and its relationship to human disease.
