**ANII Visiting Scholar**  

Marisabel is a dietitian who became interested in the human microbiome in the context of health and disease. She is now a graduate student in the Basic Sciences Program (PEDECIBA) in Microbiology at the University of the Republic (Udelar) in Uruguay. She transitioned from a strong clinical field to microbial genomics and molecular microbiology. Her goal is to contribute to both clinical and basic research. Her main research interest is exploring the composition and function of the oral and gut microbiome in patients with periodontal disease undergoing non-surgical periodontal treatment and its relationship with lifestyle factors, specifically diet and nutritional indicators. She is currently exploring the potential of nanopore sequencing for microbiome characterization. Marisabel was a Visiting Scholar in the Baker Lab in 2025.
