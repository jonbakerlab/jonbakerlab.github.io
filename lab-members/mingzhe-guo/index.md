Mingzhe Guo, Ph.D. received his graduate training at the Institut Pasteur of Shanghai, Chinese Academy of Sciences, where he focused on virology and innate immunity. He began my postdoctoral training in the Tal-Gan Lab at the University of Nevada, Reno, investigating the mechanisms behind cell-to-cell communication among oral streptococci. He then continued my training on the oral microbiome at OHSU, and is currently elucidating the role of lipid metabolism in the life cycles of multiple Streptococcus species.
